# Sol Framing Web

Prototype Next.js playground for experimenting with frame contours around a painting. The Virtual Framing
lab converts a profile contour description into an SVG preview that scales to the viewport.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/virtual-framing` to explore the demo frame profile.
